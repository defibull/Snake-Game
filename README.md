My solution to UCLA CS 32 Project 1 - Prof.Smallberg 
Character based snake game - the specs were provided by Prof. Smallberg
and part of the code is posted under permission from him. To run the
game : open Xcode, copy the files and press play ! part of my code
involves a solution I wrote earlier for another class
